# Legato Flash

![](./../../docs/html/legato_flash_run3.png)

The legato_flash demonstration application serves as an external memory programmer to flash the off-chip non-volatile memory with the resources held on an Memory Storage Device (MSD), such as a USB or a SD card, which can then be accessed by other applications saving on-chip memory for other programs and resources.

The application [legato_quickstart_external_resources](../legato_quickstart_ext_res/readme.md) in MPLAB Harmony needs to use preloaded images/fonts from QSPI flash external non-volatile memory. This would require legato_flash to flash the required image and font resources onto the QSPI flash. Refer to [legato_quickstart_external_resources](../legato_quickstart_ext_res/readme.md) for usage model information.
